CS 61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

*NOTE!* Since this is a educational project all function inputs considered to besane. That's why assignments are done without additional checkings for wrong/empty inputs.

The folders are:
- `book` - holds the exersices from a book mentioned above. Divided by chapters.
- `lectures` - for the asignments from the CS Berkeley course. Divided by weeks

Many of the functions that lecturer uses are not available for my interpetor version (like `first`, `but-last`, `wd` etc). That's why other functions are used (`car`/`cdr` for lists, some string functions, `cons` for appending and so on)
